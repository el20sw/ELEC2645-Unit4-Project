  N5110 Class
  ===========
  
  Library for interfacing with Nokia 5110 LCD display (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10168) using 
  the hardware SPI on the mbed.The display is powered from a GPIO pin meaning it can be controlled via 
  software. The LED backlight is also software-controllable (via PWM pin). Can print characters and
  strings to the display using the included 5x7 font. The library also implements a screen buffer so 
  that individual pixels on the display (84 x 48) can be set, cleared and read. The library can print 
  primitive shapes (lines, circles, rectangles). Acknowledgements to Chris Yan's Nokia_5110 Library.
